### installation

npx -p ghost-cli ghost install local

very hacky install, start a hidden "production" server process

creates 1024 files, most of them useless to our setup

using the ghost instance is poorly documented to avoid the cli output topology

### home page

requests account creation

### content

content types seem set in stone, the CMS is meant to be used as is ?

### dev

no dev server

### startup

2.2 seconds
